# Native SDK Consumer Example

This folder is a minimal consumer that installs `@codex-native/sdk` and loads it as a dependency.

## Usage

1. Install deps:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Run the smoke script:

   ```sh
   pnpm start
   ```

If you want to test a published version, update the dependency in `package.json`.
